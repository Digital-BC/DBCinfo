                                        These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                                        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
                                        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,
                                        though the transition does limit overflow.

DigitalBC brings together a wide range of cultural information about British Columbia under one digital roof. It allows anyone in the world, like students, writers and researchers, and [community members / members of the public], to easily find and access information that includes art, images, newspapers, maps, and published papers and books that come from galleries, libraries, archives and museums across the province. The project may include content from Indigenous communities who choose to participate.
</p>
<p>
Consider Digital BC a doorway to the stories of the province. It’s a grassroots project with support from cultural and academic institutions all over British Columbia including Vancouver Island Regional Library, Kelowna Art Gallery, BCMA, Vancouver Island University, Vancouver Community College, and Museum of Surrey. The goal is to include all the stories of our province wherever they come from – from Skidegate to Surrey to Slocan and everywhere in between. While DigitalBC is wholly unique, there is nothing else like it in Canada, there is also great potential to connect and collaborate with like-minded initiatives as they emerge.
</p>
<p> 
The project is currently under development with the aim to launch a prototype in 2025. If you are interested in finding out more about this project, email info@digitalbc.ca.
