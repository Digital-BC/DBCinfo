<p class="dropcap">At a Steering Committee meeting in July 2016, the hub and spoke model was put forward as a best practice for the BCDL project. The hub and spoke model connects different organizations, in varying sizes and complexities, in a distributed network of content and service providers. Service hubs may provide different services from a full menu of standardized digital services which could include digitatizion, metadata assistance, data aggregation and storage. Content hubs are usually larger digital libraries, museums and repositories that maintain a one-to-one relationship with the central repository. The hub and spoke model is used by other larger repository efforts such as DPLA, DigitalNZ and Europa. It provides a way for small and large organizations to participate and be exposed through the same initiative.
