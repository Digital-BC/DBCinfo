* [INKE (Implementing New Knowledge Environments) 2019: The BD Digital Library Initiative](https://praeclusio.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/DBCweb/pdfs/INKE_2019_final.pdf)

Vancouver Island Library Staff Conference, April 27, 2018 	

Surfacing collections across Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) allows us to tell stories and share otherwise obscure specimens, artifacts, or records. A BC Digital Library has transformative potential to show complexity of people and places to amplify local collections, and to make our past available to help shape social discourse.

But it must be built, and maintained into the future. A growing group of GLAM institutions are finding ways to get it done through radical collaboration.  A panel discussion with Ben Hyman, Dave Steward and Daniel Sifton.

Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, June 29-23, 2017, Toronto 	

A showcase for the cloud-based docker instance of Supplejack. Poster includes the process for harvesting and ingesting metadata from both the BC and the Ontario jurisdictions in a variety of schemas and formats, from IRs at GLAM institutions and even places like YouTube.  Three separate Ember.js front ends: one for ON, one for BC, and one that does both, and scoped user permisions for the harvesting interface by region included. Coupled with the architecture this allows for the implementation of a shared supplejack instance, either on a large scale (i.e. cross provincial) or a smaller scale (shared hub instances in a single province).
